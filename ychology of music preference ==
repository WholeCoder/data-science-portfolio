A '''music genre''' is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of [[music]] as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions.<ref>Samson, Jim. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/40599 "Genre"]. In Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Accessed March 4, 2012.</ref> It is to be distinguished from ''[[musical form]]'' and ''musical style'', although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably.<ref>{{cite web|author=Janice Wong|year=2011|title=Visualising Music: The Problems with Genre Classification|url=http://mastersofmedia.hum.uva.nl/2011/04/26/visualising-music-the-problems-with-genre-classification/}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=December 2014}} Recently, academics have argued that categorizing music by genre is inaccurate and outdated.<ref name=ECON>{{cite web|url=http://www.econotimes.com/Musical-genres-are-out-of-date-%E2%80%93-but-this-new-system-explains-why-you-might-like-both-jazz-and-hip-hop-244941|publisher=Econotimes|date=3 August 2016|accessdate=8 August 2016|title=Musical genres are out of date – but this new system explains why you might like both jazz and hip hop}}</ref>

Music can be divided into different [[genre]]s in many different ways. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often subjective and controversial, and some genres may overlap. There are even varying academic definitions of the term ''genre ''itself. In his book ''Form in Tonal Music'', Douglass M. Green distinguishes between genre and [[Musical form|form]]. He lists [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], [[motet]], [[canzona]], [[ricercar]], and dance as examples of genres from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] period. To further clarify the meaning of ''genre'', Green writes, "Beethoven's Op. 61 and Mendelssohn's Op. 64 are identical in genre – both are violin concertos – but different in form. However, Mozart's Rondo for Piano, K. 511, and the ''Agnus Dei'' from his Mass, K. 317 are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form."<ref>{{cite book|title=Form in Tonal Music|last=Green|first=Douglass M.|year=1965|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, Inc|isbn=978-0-03-020286-5|page=1}}</ref> Some, like [[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|Peter van der Merwe]], treat the terms ''genre'' and ''style'' as the same, saying that ''genre'' should be defined as pieces of music that share a certain style or "basic musical language."<ref name=Pete>{{cite book|title=Origins of the Popular Style: The Antecedents of Twentieth-Century Popular Music|last=van der Merwe|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|year=1989|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-316121-4|page=3}}</ref> Others, such as Allan F. Moore, state that ''genre'' and ''style'' are two separate terms, and that secondary characteristics such as subject matter can also differentiate between genres.<ref name=Moore>Moore, Allan F.
[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3526163 "Categorical Conventions in Music Discourse: Style and Genre"]. ''Music & Letters'', Vol. 82, No. 3 (Aug. 2001), pp. 432–442.</ref> A music genre or subgenre may also be defined by the [[musical technique]]s, the style, the cultural context, and the content and spirit of the themes. Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres. Timothy Laurie argues that since the early 1980s, "genre has graduated from being a subset of popular music studies to being an almost ubiquitous framework for constituting and evaluating musical research objects".<ref>{{Cite news | title= Music Genre As Method | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | newspaper= Cultural Studies Review | year= 2014 | url= https://www.academia.edu/9087511}} 20 (2), pp. 283-292.</ref>

Among the criteria often used to classify musical genres are the trichotomy of art, popular, and traditional musics.

Alternatively, music can be divided on three variables: arousal, valence, and depth.<ref name=ECON/> Arousal reflects the energy level of the music; valence reflects the scale from sad to happy emotions, and depth reflects the level of emotional depth in the music.<ref name=ECON/> These three variables help explain why many people like similar songs from different traditionally segregated genres.<ref name=ECON/>

Musicologists have sometimes classified music according to a trichotomic distinction such as Philip Tagg's "axiomatic triangle consisting of 'folk', 'art' and 'popular' musics".<ref name="Analysing Popular Music 1982, p. 41">Tagg, Philip. "Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice". ''Popular Music'' 2 (1982): 41.</ref> He explains that each of these three is distinguishable from the others according to certain criteria.<ref name="Analysing Popular Music 1982, p. 41"/>

==Art music==
{{Main|Art music}}
{{See also|List of art music traditions}}

Art music primarily includes classical traditions, including both [[contemporary classical music|contemporary]] and historical classical music forms. Art music exists in many parts of the world. It emphasizes formal styles that invite technical and detailed deconstruction<ref>Siron, Jacques. "Musique Savante (Serious Music)". ''Dictionnaire des mots de la musique'' (Paris: Outre Mesure): 242.</ref> and criticism, and demand focused attention from the listener. In Western practice, art music is considered primarily a written musical tradition,<ref name="Arnold, Denis">Arnold, Denis: "Art Music, Art Song", in ''The New Oxford Companion to Music, Volume 1: A-J'' (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1983): 111.</ref> preserved in some form of [[musical notation|music notation]] rather than being transmitted orally, by rote, or in recordings, as [[popular music|popular]] and [[traditional music]] usually are.<ref name="Arnold, Denis"/><ref>Tagg, Philip. "Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice". ''Popular Music'' 2 (1982): 37–67, here 41–42.</ref> Historically, most western art music has been written down using the standard forms of music notation that evolved in Europe, beginning well before the Renaissance and reaching its maturity in the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] period. The identity of a "work" or "piece" of art music is usually defined by the notated version rather than by a particular performance, and is primarily associated with the composer rather than the performer (though composers may leave performers with some opportunity for interpretation or improvisation). This is so particularly in the case of western classical music. Art music may include certain forms of [[jazz]], though some feel that jazz is primarily a form of popular music. The 1960s saw a wave of avant-garde experimentation in free [[jazz]], represented by artists such as [[Ornette Coleman]], [[Sun Ra]], [[Albert Ayler]], [[Archie Shepp]] and Don Cherry.<ref>Anon. [http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/avant-garde-jazz-ma0000002438 Avant-Garde Jazz]. AllMusic.com, n.d.</ref> And avant-garde rock artists such as [[Frank Zappa]], Captain Beefheart, and The Residents released art music albums.

==Popular music==
{{Main|Popular music}}
[[File:Jennifer Lopez - Pop Music Festival (35).jpg|thumb|Jennifer Lopez performing at a pop music festival]]
Popular music is any musical style accessible to the general public and disseminated by the [[mass media]]. Musicologist and popular music specialist Philip Tagg defined the notion in the light of sociocultural and economical aspects:

<blockquote>Popular music, unlike art music, is (1) conceived for mass distribution to large and often socioculturally heterogeneous groups of listeners, (2) stored and distributed in non-written form, (3) only possible in an industrial monetary economy where it becomes a commodity and (4) in capitalist societies, subject to the laws of 'free' enterprise&nbsp;... it should ideally sell as much as possible.<ref name="Analysing Popular Music 1982, p. 41"/></blockquote>

Popular music is found on most commercial and [[public service]] radio stations, in most commercial music retailers and department stores, and in movie and television soundtracks. It is noted on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] and, in addition to singer-songwriters and composers, it involves music producers more than other genres do.

The distinction between classical and popular music has sometimes been blurred in marginal areas<ref>Arnold, Denis (1983): "Art Music, Art Song", in ''The New Oxford Companion to Music, Volume 1: A-J'', Oxford University Press, p. 111, {{ISBN|0-19-311316-3}}.</ref> such as [[minimalist music]] and light classics. Background music for films/movies often draws on both traditions. In this respect, music is like fiction, which likewise draws a distinction between [[literary fiction]] and [[popular fiction]] that is not always precise.

===Rock music===
{{Main|Rock music}}
Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as "rock and roll" in the United States in the early 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and in the United States.

===Soul music/R&B===
{{Main|Soul music}}
Soul music became a musical genre that came to include a wide variety of R&B-based music styles from the pop R&B acts at [[Motown Records]] in [[Detroit]], such as [[The Temptations]], [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Four Tops]], to "[[deep soul]]" singers such as [[Percy Sledge]] and [[James Carr (musician)|James Carr]].<ref name="Motown Museum">{{cite web|title=Motown: The Sound that Changed America|url=https://www.motownmuseum.org/story/motown/|website=Motown Museum|accessdate=October 27, 2016}}</ref>

=== Hip hop music ===
[[File:DJ Hypnotize and Baby Cee.jpg|thumb|Two DJs practicing [[turntablism]]]]
{{Main|Hip hop music}}
Hip Hop music, also referred to as ''hip hop'' or ''rap music'', is a genre of music that was started in the United States, specifically the South Bronx in the New York City, New York, by African-American youth from the inner-cities during the 1970s. It can be broadly defined as a stylized rhythmic music that commonly accompanies [[rapping]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hip+hop|title=Definition of HIP HOP|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-13}}</ref> a rhythmic and rhyming speech that is chanted.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/rap|title=Rap {{!}} music|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-03-13}}</ref> Hip hop music derives from the hip hop culture itself, including four key elements, those being emceeing([[Master of ceremonies|MCing]])/[[rapping]], Disc jockeying ([[Disc jockey|DJing]]) with [[turntablism]], [[Breakdancing|break dancing]] and [[Graffiti|graffiti art]].

===Polka===
{{Main|Polka}}
The polka is originally a Czech dance and genre of dance music familiar throughout Europe and the Americas.

==Religious music==
{{Main|Religious music}}

== Traditional and folk music ==
{{Main|Traditional music}}{{Unreliable sources section|date=May 2019}}[[File:Sonolite.jpg|alt=A picture of a red and black button accordion|thumb|[[Button accordion]]: German instrument used in several different cultures]]
Traditional and Folk music are very similar categories. Although the traditional music is a very broad category and can include several different genres, it is widely accepted that traditional music encompasses folk music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.traditionalmusic.org/traditionalmusicdefinition.shtml|title=What is Traditional Music? - a broad definition|website=www.traditionalmusic.org|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref> According to the [[International Council for Traditional Music|ICTM]] (International Council for Traditional Music), traditional music are songs and tunes which have been performed over a long period of time (usually several generations)'''.''' <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ictmusic.org/|title=Home {{!}} International Council for Traditional Music|website=ictmusic.org|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref>

The [[Folk music]] genre is classified as the music that is orally passed from one generation to another. Usually the artist is unknown, and there are several different versions of the same song.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.earmaster.com/|title=EarMaster - Music Theory & Ear Training on PC, Mac and iPad|website=www.earmaster.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref> The genre is transmitted by singing, listening and dancing to popular songs. This type of communication allows culture to transmit the styles (pitches and cadences) as well as the context it was developed.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Albrecht|first=Joshua|last2=Shanahan|first2=Daniel|date=2019-02-01|title=Examining the Effect of Oral Transmission on Folksongs|journal=Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal|language=en|volume=36|issue=3|pages=273–288|doi=10.1525/mp.2019.36.3.273|issn=0730-7829}}</ref>

Some of the main aspects about culturally transmitting folk songs, its about the period of history it was created and the social class in which was developed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/folk-music|title=Folk music|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref> Some examples of the Folk Genre can be seen in the [[English folk music|Folk music of England]] and [[Turkish folk music|Turkish Folk music]]. English folk music was developed since the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]] and it has transmitted from that time until today. Similarly, the Turkish Folk music relates to all the civilizations that once passed thorough Turkey, therefore being a world-reference since the tensions between East-West during the [[Early Modern history|Early Modern Period]].

Traditional Folk music usually refers to songs composed in the 20th century, which tends to be written as universal truths and big issues of the time it was composed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/style/traditional-folk-ma0000004419/songs|title=Traditional Folk Music Songs|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref> Great names such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Peter, Paul and Mary|Peter Paul and Mary]], [[James Taylor]], and [[Leonard Cohen]] transformed the Folk music on what it is known today. Some newer composers, such as [[Ed Sheeran]] (Pop Folk), and [[The Lumineers]] (American Folk) are both newer examples of [[Contemporary folk music|Contemporary Folk music,]] which has been recorded and adapted to the new way of listening to music (online) on the contrary of the traditional way of orally transmitting music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nazandella.com/single-post/2017/04/01/Is-folk-music-dying-out|title=Is folk music dying out? {{!}} Naz & Ella {{!}} Indie-Folk Duo {{!}} London|website=Naz &amp; Ella {{!}} Indie-Folk Duo {{!}} London|language=en|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref>

Each country in the world, in some cases each region, district and community has its own Folk Music style. The different sub-divisions of Folk genre is developed by each place cultural identity and history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cabrillo.edu/~mstrunk/Music12/Wk11/European%20Folk%20Music.htm|title=THE GENERAL CHARACTER OF EUROPEAN FOLK MUSIC|website=www.cabrillo.edu|access-date=2019-04-01}}</ref> Because the music is developed in different places, a lot of the instruments are characteristic to its location and population, but some of them are similar everywhere, some examples are: [[Button accordion|Button]] or [[Piano accordion|Piano Accordion]], different types of [[flute]]s or [[trumpet]]s, [[Banjo]], and [[Ukulele]]. Both French and Scottish folk music uses related instruments such as the Fiddle, the harp and variations of bagpipes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/212113558/what-instruments-are-used-in-typical-french-folk-music|title=what instruments are used in typical french folk music {{!}} Folk Music {{!}} Performing Arts|website=Scribd|language=en|access-date=2019-04-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tv-english.club/articles-en/discover-great-britain-en/scottish-traditional-music/|title=Traditional Scottish Music|date=2015-10-29|website=English Club TV On-the-Go|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-04}}</ref><br />

==Automatic categorization==
{{Expand section|date=February 2014}}

Automatic methods of musical similarity detection, based on [[data mining]] and [[co-occurrence]] analysis, have been developed in order to classify music titles for electronic music distribution.<ref>François Pachet, Geert Westermann, Damien Laigre. [http://www.csl.sony.fr/downloads/papers/2001/pachet01c.pdf "Musical Data Mining for Electronic Music Distribution"]. ''Proceedings of the 1st WedelMusic Conference''sou, pp. 101-106, Firenze, Italy, 2001.</ref>

==Emergence of new genres and sub-genres==
{{catmore|Fusion (music)}}

New genres can arise by the development of new forms and styles of music and also simply by creating a new categorization. Although it is conceivable to create a musical style with no relation to existing genres, new styles usually appear under the influence of preexisting genres. The [[genealogy of musical genres]] expresses, often in the form of a written chart, the way in which new genres have developed under the influence of older ones. If two or more existing genres influence the emergence of a new one, a fusion between them can be said to have taken place. The proliferation of popular music in the 20th century has led to over 1,200 definable sub-genres of music.<ref name="guardian" />

=== Social influences on music selection ===
Since music has become more easily accessible ([[Spotify]], [[iTunes]], [[YouTube]], etc.), more people have begun listening to a broader and wider range of music styles.<ref name=":02">{{Cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/mr-personality/201101/the-psychology-musical-preferences|title=The Psychology of Musical Preferences|last=Chamorro-Premuzic|first=Tomas|date=January 14, 2011|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-03-27}}</ref> In addition, social identity also plays a large role in music preference. Personality is a key contributor for music selection. Someone who considers themselves to be a "rebel" will tend to choose heavier music styles like [[Heavy metal music|Heavy Metal]] or [[Hard rock|Hard Rock]], while someone who considers themselves to be more "relaxed" or "laid back" will tend to choose lighter music styles like [[Jazz]] or [[Classical music|Classical]] music.<ref name=":02" /> There are five main factors that exist that underlie music preferences that are genre-free, and reflect emotional/affective responses.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Rentfrow|first=Peter J.|last2=Goldberg|first2=Lewis R.|last3=Levitin|first3=Daniel J.|date=2011|title=The structure of musical preferences: A five-factor model.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=100|issue=6|pages=1139–1157|doi=10.1037/a0022406|issn=1939-1315|pmc=3138530|pmid=21299309}}</ref> These five factors are:

# A Mellow factor consisting of smooth and relaxing styles (Jazz, Classical, etc.).
# An Urban factor defined largely by rhythmic and percussive music (Rap, [[Hip hop music|Hip-Hop]], [[Funk]], etc.).
# A Sophisticated factor ([[Opera music|Operatic]], [[World music|World]], etc.)
# An Intensity factor that is defined by forceful, loud, and energetic music (Rock, Metal, etc.).
# A campestral factor which refers to singer-songwriter genres and country.<ref name=":1" />

=== Individual and situational influences ===
==== Gender ====
Studies have shown that while women prefer more treble oriented music, men prefer to listen to bass heavy music. This is sometimes paired with [[Borderline personality disorder|borderline]] and [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] personalities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McCown|first=William|last2=Keiser, Ross|last3=Mulhearn, Shea|last4=Williamson, David|date=October 1997|title=The role of personality and gender in preference for exaggerated bass in music|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=23|issue=4|pages=543–547|doi=10.1016/s0191-8869(97)00085-8}}</ref>

==== Age ====
Age is another strong factor that contributes to musical preference. Evidence is available that shows that music preference can change as one gets older.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bonneville-Roussy|first=Arielle|last2=Rentfrow|first2=Peter J.|last3=Xu|first3=Man K.|last4=Potter|first4=Jeff|title=Music through the ages: Trends in musical engagement and preferences from adolescence through middle adulthood.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=105|issue=4|pages=703–717|doi=10.1037/a0033770|pmid=23895269|year=2013}}</ref> A Canadian study showed that adolescents show greater interest in pop music artists while adults and the elderly population prefer classic genres such as [[Rock music|Rock]], [[Opera]], and [[Jazz]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Kelly|last2=Fouts|last3=Gregory|year=2003|title=Music preferences, personality style, and developmental issues of adolescents|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|volume=32|issue=3|pages=205–213|doi=10.1023/a:1022547520656}}</ref>
