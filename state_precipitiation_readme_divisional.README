The major parameters in this file are sequential "Time Biased Corrected" state
climatic division monthly Average Temperatures (Deg.F. to 10ths), Precipitation
(Inches to 100ths), Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), and Palmer Drought 
Indices (PDSI, PHDI, PMDI, and ZNDX). Period of record is 1895 through latest 
month available, updated monthly.

Monthly averages within a climatic division have been calculated by giving
equal weight to stations reporting both temperature and precipitation within a
division. In the U.S., observers at cooperative stations often take one
observation per day, and the ending time of the climatological day at any
station can vary from station-to-station as well as year-to-year.  Differences
of the 24-hour period over which each observer reports his or her maximum and 
minimum temperature as well as the average temperature [(max + min)/2] affects 
the calculated monthly mean temperature.  Karl, et al. (1986), describe the 
biases that this introduces. These potential biases were rectified by 
adjusting for these varying observation times.  The model described by Karl, 
et al. (1986), was used to adjust the climate division averages such that all 
stations end their climatological day at midnight; i.e., climatological day 
coincides with calendar day.  The time of observation was determined at each 
station within a climate division during January of the years 1931, 1941, 1951,
1965, 1975, and 1984 for the states of California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana,
New York, North Carolina, and Washington.  The fraction of observers recording 
at various hours of the day was calculated and interpolated for intervening
years (extrapolated for subsequent years).  For these seven states, the ending 
time of observation was grouped into three categories:  AM, PM, and MD.
The AM category included observers who ended their climatological day between
3 AM and 11AM; the PM category between noon and 9 PM; and the MD category
between 10 PM and 2 AM; all local standard time.  The fraction of observers in
these categories was calculated, and it was assumed the 7 AM observation time 
best represented the AM category; the 5 PM observation time, the PM category; 
and midnight for the MD category.  The reason for the simplification was to 
test if a faster method, requiring significantly less bookkeeping and 
keypunching, could not provide nearly as good results as calculating the 
fraction of observers at each of the 24 hours of the day.

The time of observation bias model was run by using the latitude and longitude 
of each of the centroids of the climate divisions.  The output from the model 
was the time of observation bias, with respect to a midnight-to-midnight 
climatological day, for each of the possible ending hours of the climatological
day.  Each climate division's monthly average was then adjusted by weighting 
the bias at any given hour by the fraction of stations within the climate 
division observing at that hour, and subtracting the result for the reported 
monthly mean temperature.

Differences of the biases were small (< 0.3 Deg. F.) for those calculated by
categorizing the ending time of observation into three categories compared to
those obtained from calculating the fraction of stations with observation times
at each of the 24 hours of the day.  This is attributed to the preponderance of
AM observation times falling between 6 AM and 9 AM, and PM observation times
falling between 4 PM and 7 PM.  As a result, by assuming 7 AM observation for 
all AM stations and 5 PM for all PM stations, a good estimate of the median 
bias is obtained for all AM or PM observations.  Furthermore, nearly all the MD
stations observed at midnight.

It should also be noted that the borders of the climate divisions in 1951 were 
not consistent with those defined in 1965.  Due to the substantial additional 
effort it would have required locating each station within three or four 
climate divisions, as defined today, the change in the statewide percentage of 
AM, PM, and MD observation times was applied in equal proportions to all 
climate divisions prior to and including 1951.

Based on small differences between the two methods of estimating the time of
observation bias, the simpler categorical procedure was used for all climate
divisions.  This should effectively eliminate most of the biases (over 2 Deg.F)
in some climate divisions that have become part of the divisional averages.  
These biases affect both trends and actual estimates of divisional averages.  
Reference Karl, et al. (1986):  "A model to estimate the time of observation 
bias associated with monthly mean maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures for 
the Unites States" (Thomas R. Karl, Claude N. Williams, Jr., and Pamela J.
Young, National Climatic Data Center, and Wayne M. Wendland, Illinois State 
Water Survey, Journal of Climate and Applied Meteorology, January 1986, 
American Meteorological Society, Boston, MA).  The time of observation bias 
model which can be used for the maximum, minimum, and mean monthly temperature 
at any location in the contiguous U.S. [program NCC*F11SRC (OBTBIAS Code) and 
NCC*F11REL (OBTBIAS)], is available from the NCDC.

Monthly heating and cooling degree day values are available in this file for 
the period 1895 to present.  The divisional degree day values are derived from 
the unadjusted temperatures using a statistical algorithm.  The heating and
cooling degree day values available at this site are used for operational
monitoring purposes and may be different from the heating and cooling degree 
day values published in official degree day publications.

Historical drought data have been added to this file for the period 1895 to
present.  The file is updated monthly.  All drought data are calibrated using 
the period 1931-1990 (cf. Karl, 1986; Journal of Climate and Applied 
Meteorology, Vol. 25, No. 1, January 1986).  Drought data include:  

1.  Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)

 This is the monthly value (index) that is generated indicating the severity
 of a wet or dry spell.  This index is based on the principles of a balance
 between moisture supply and demand.  Man-made changes were not considered in
 this calculation.  The index generally ranges from -6 to +6, with negative
 values denoting dry spells and positive values indicating wet spells.  There
 are a few values in the magnitude of +7 or -7.  PDSI values 0 to -.5 =
 normal; -0.5 to -1.0 = incipient drought; -1.0 to -2.0 = mild drought; -2.0
 to -3.0 = moderate drought; -3.0 to -4.0 = severe drought; and greater than -
 4.0 = extreme drought.  Similar adjectives are attached to positive values of
 wet spells.  This is a meteorological drought index used to assess the
 severity of dry or wet spells of weather.

2.  Palmer Hydrological Drought Index (PHDI)

 This is the monthly value (index) generated monthly that indicates the
 severity of a wet or dry spell.  This index is based on the principles of a
 balance between moisture supply and demand.  Man-made changes such as
 increased irrigation, new reservoirs, and added industrial water use were not
 included in the computation of this index.  The index generally ranges from -
 6 to +6, with negative values denoting dry spells, and positive values
 indicating wet spells.  There are a few values in the magnitude of +7 or -7. 
 PHDI values 0 to -0.5 = normal; -0.5 to -1.0 = incipient drought; -1.0 to -
 2.0 = mild drought; -2.0 to -3.0 = moderate drought; -3.0 to -4.0 = severe
 drought; and greater than -4.0 = extreme drought.  Similar adjectives are
 attached to positive values of wet spells.  This is a hydrological drought
 index used to assess long-term moisture supply.

3.  Palmer "Z" Index (ZNDX)

 This is the generated monthly Z values, and they can be expressed as the
 "Moisture Anomaly Index."  Each monthly Z value is a measure of the departure
 from normal of the moisture climate for that month.  This index can respond
 to a month of above-normal precipitation, even during periods of drought. 
 Table 1 contains expected values of the Z index and other drought parameters. 
 See Historical Climatology Series 3-6 through 3-9 for a detailed description
 of the drought indices.

4.  Modified Palmer Drought Severity Index (PMDI)

 This is a modification of the Palmer Drought Severity Index.  The
 modification was made by the National Weather Service Climate Analysis Center
 for operational meteorological purposes.  The Palmer drought program
 calculates three intermediate parallel index values each month.  Only one
 value is selected as the PDSI drought index for the month.  This selection is
 made internally by the program on the basis of probabilities.  If the
 probability that a drought is over is 100%, then one index is used.  If the
 probability that a wet spell is over is 100%, then another index is used.  If
 the probability is between 0% and 100%, the third index is assigned to the
 PDSI.  The modification (PMDI) incorporates a weighted average of the wet and
 dry index terms, using the probability as the weighting factor.  (Thomas R.
 Heddinghause and Paul Sabol, 1991; "A Review of the Palmer Drought Severity
 Index and Where Do We Go From Here?," Proceedings of the Seventh Conference
 on Applied Climatology, pp. 242-246, American Meteorological Society, Boston,
 MA).  The PMDI and PDSI will have the same value during an established
 drought or wet spell (i.e., when the probability is 100%), but they will have
 different values during transition periods.

5.  Standardized Precipitation Index (SPxx)

This is a transformation of the probability of observing a given amount of 
precipitation in xx months.  A zero index value reflects the median of the 
distribution of precipitation, a -3 indicates a very extreme dry spell, and a 
+3 indicates a very extreme wet spell.  The more the index value departs from 
zero, the drier or wetter an event lasting xx months is when compared to the 
long-term climatology of the location.  The index allows for comparison of 
precipitation observations at different locations with markedly different 
climates; an index value at one location expresses the same relative departure 
from median conditions at one location as at another location.  It is 
calculated for different time scales since it is possible to experience dry 
conditions over one time scale while simultaneously experiencing wet conditions 
over a different time scale.
